          p.card-text Upload a list of supporters you want to turn out. Then you can deploy pollwatchers to watch the polls for your supporters to show up, call them directly, or go to their door to get them to the polls. Once they've voted, have your pollwatcher X them out, and focus on the rest of your list.
